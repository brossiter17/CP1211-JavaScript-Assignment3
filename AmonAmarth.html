            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Amon Amarth</b> is a Swedish <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melodic_death_metal" target="_blank"><i>melodic death metal</i></a> band from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumba,_Sweden#" target="_blank">Tumba, Sweden</a>, 
            formed in 1992. The band takes its name from J. R. R. Tolkien lore. Their lyrics 
            mostly deal with Viking mythology and history, so they have been sometimes erroneously labeled <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viking_metal" target="_blank">Viking metal</a>, although the band insists
            they play melodic death metal.
        </p>
    
        <p class="grid-item2" id="history"><u>A Brief History</u> 
            <br>          
            <br>          
            One of the most respected and consistent forces in the melodic death metal scene, Sweden's Amon Amarth emerged in the early '90s with a sound 
            that infused traditional scorched-earth Scandinavian death metal with Viking history and lore. They broke into the mainstream in 2008 with the
            release of their landmark seventh LP <i>Twilight of the Thunder God</i>, which charted both at home and abroad, paving the way for subsequent triumphs 
            like <i>Deceiver of the Gods</i> (2013) and <i>Berserker</i> (2019). The Great Heathen Army followed in 2022.
            <br>          
            <br>          
            The seeds for the group were sewn in 1988 under the moniker Scum, which featured vocalist Paul Mäkitalo (<a href="https://www.darkfuneral.se/" target="_blank">Dark Funeral)</a>, lead guitarist 
            Olavi Mikkonen, bass player Petri Tarvainen, and rhythm guitarist Vesa Meriläinen. Four years later, a re-tooled lineup consisting of 
            vocalist Johan Hegg, guitarists Mikkonen and Anders Hansson, bassist Ted Lundstrom, and drummer Niko Kaukinen began operating as Amon 
            Amarth, taking their name from the Sindarin translation of Mount Doom, the cursed volcano in J.R.R. Tolkien's fantasy epic The Lord of 
            the Rings. In 1993, the quintet recorded their first demo <i>Thor Arise</i>, which went unreleased due to sound problems; a second demo, <i>Arrival 
            of the Fimbul Winter</i>, followed in 1994, quickly selling out all 1,000 copies. Signing to the Singapore-based <a href="https://www.pulverised.net/" target="_blank">Pulverised Records</a> label, Amon Amarth 
            issued the EP <i>Sorrow Throughout the Nine Worlds</i> in the middle of 1996; soon after, Kaukinen exited and was replaced by drummer Martin Lopez 
            for 1998's full-length <i>Once Sent from the Golden Hall</i>. The LP, released on <a href="https://www.metalblade.com/us/" target="_blank">Metal Blade Records</a>, helped establish the band as a force to be reckoned 
            with in the death metal community. Hansson left shortly after the album's release, making way for new guitarist Johan Söderberg and drummer 
            Fredrik Andersson, who made their studio debut on 1999's <i>Avenger</i> -- this would prove to be the strongest and most prolific iteration of the 
            group, lasting well into the 2010s.
            <br>          
            <br>  
            The punishing and aptly named <i>Crusher</i> arrived in 2001, followed in 2002 by the dark and melancholic <i>Versus the World</i>, the latter of which 
            introduced a more measured, bottom-heavy style. 2004's <i>Fate of Norns</i> continued in that vein, and was followed in 2006 by <i>With Oden on Our 
            Side</i>, which was the band's first album to enter the Billboard charts. 2008's <i>Twilight of the Thunder God</i> became Amon Amarth's most 
            critically acclaimed and commercially successful outing to date, landing in the Top Ten of numerous year-end lists. In 2011, the group 
            released their eighth studio album, <i>Surtur Rising</i>, followed by a world tour alongside metal luminaries <a href="https://www.cobhc.com/" target="_blank">Children of Bodom</a> 
            and <a href="https://ensiferum.com/" target="_blank">Ensiferum</a>, among others. <i>Deceiver of the Gods</i>, which featured a guest appearance by former <a href="https://www.candlemass.se/" target="_bland">Candlemass</a> 
            vocalist Messiah Marcolin, arrived in 2013.  Two years later saw the departure of longtime drummer Fredrik Andersson. The band recruited session kit man Tobias Gustafsson 
            for 2016's <i>Jomsviking</i>, and tapped Jocke Wallgren as the official replacement shortly thereafter. Wallgren made his studio debut on Amon Amarth's 
            11th album, 2019's <i>Berserker</i>. In May 2021, the band issued a re-recorded version of the classic 2001 track "Masters of War" 
            in celebration of the 20th anniversary of the release of The <i>Crusher</i>. In June 2022 they the band announced the August release of <i>The 
            Great Heathen Army</i> with the music video "Get in the Ring," written especially for AEW pro-wrestler Erick Redbeard -- he also starred 
            in it. The nine-track album was produced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Sneap" target="_blank">Andy Sneap</a> and showcased a renewed emphasis on crushing death metal.

        <p class="grid-item3" id="music"><u>Musical Style and Lyrics</u>
            <br>
            <br>
            Under their original name Scum, the band played <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grindcore" target="_blank">grindcore</a>. However, in 1992 the band changed their name 
            to Amon Amarth and adopted a more death metal orientated style. The band is now usually considered melodic
            death metal.
            <br>          
            <br> 
            The band bases most of its song lyrics on Norse mythology, the Viking Age, and the pre-Christian world, 
            which thematically comprise a heavy metal style known as Viking metal. Viking metal originally emerged 
            in the late 1980s and early 1990s as an ideological offshoot of black metal, made popular by such bands 
            as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bathory_(band)" target="_blank">Bathory</a> and <a href="https://enslaved.no/" target="_blank">Enslaved</a>. Amon Amarth, though a death metal band, is often labeled as Viking metal due 
            to its lyrical themes.
            <br>          
            <br>    
            In regard to the band's reputation as a Viking metal band, Imke von Helden writes in <cite>"Barbarians and 
            Literature: Viking Metal and its Links to Old Norse Mythology"</cite> that <q>During the 1990s, Swedish Amon 
            Amarth added a new dimension to the definition of viking metal by means of its death metal style of music.</q> 
            She further explains in <cite>"Scandinavian Metal Attack: The Power of Northern Europe in Extreme Metal"</cite> that
            <br>          
            <br>          
            "Though most Viking metal bands have a black metal background, Viking metal is defined by topics rather than music. That is why death metal 
            bands like Amon Amarth and Unleashed are often included in the league of Viking metal bands."  —Imke von Helden
            <br>          
            <br>    
            "We play death metal. We write about Vikings so, therefore, some refer us to Viking metal, but I have no idea what that is. I can't 
            imagine the Vikings were into metal at all except on the swords and stuff. And musically, I guess they only played these strange lip
            instruments and some bongos or whatever."  —Johan Hegg   
            <br>          
            <br>    
            Hegg has also addressed the band's relationship to the pagan metal phenomenon and its choice of subject matter:
            <br>          
            <br>    
            "We don't really see ourselves as one of those bands doing pagan folklore music. The reason we took the Viking theme and mythology 
            theme as a lyrical theme for the band was, perhaps, more accidental from the start. When we wrote the first song with Viking lyrics, 
            we felt it was a topic that suited the music that we wanted to write really well...It was something different, as well, from a 
            lot of other bands. In Sweden, I think only Bathory and Unleashed had done anything like it. For us, it was to do something different, 
            to stand out a little bit, to use those lyrics."  -Johan Hegg
    
            Amon Amarth are know for their high energy live shows but there is one thing that seperates their fans from fans of other bands.  
            At most heavy metal shows the audience will <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moshing" target="_blank">mosh</a> but Amon Amarth fans 
            do something a little different.  In keeping with the Viking way, their fans have a "rowing pit".  Fans will sit on the sit on the floor
            and simulate rowing a Viking ship.
